## Gluten Free Curry - Tokyo

We arrived in Tokyo at about 6PM. After our 13 hour flight we settled in and had our goals set on getting some food and then maybe a drink and going to bed by 9PM. We decied to try [CURRY HOUSE CoCo ICHIBANYA](https://www.ichibanya.co.jp/english/) because they were going to be quick without much wait and we wanted to try the gluten free curry. They have an allergen free curry that is issentially the curry base with vegtables on top of rice and the curry comes in its own seperated packet so you can be sure that its safe to eat. This was a great dish that only needed extra spice but it was a great option for quick hot meal.
