## Tokyo - Day 1

We arrived on Friday and decided that we would stay up until 9PM so we could adjust to the new daylight hours. We had about 4 hours to kill so we headed to our hotel first. We stayed at [JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom](https://www.jrk-hotels.co.jp/Shinjuku/) in the Shinjuku ward of Tokyo. We got checked in and took some showers and then headed out. We knew we wanted to try a nearby [curry house](#gluten-free-curry---tokyo) that we knew had a gluten free option and would be relatively quick to get in and get out. We walked from the hotel to the nearest curry house, got our curry and decided to walk around and take in the sights. We walked down some alleyways and there were people all over enjoying themselves on a Friday night. We walked into a random bar that had some space and had some drinks and food. I tried some Japanese whiskey on the rocks and we got some chicken wings and some pickled edaname. When we were done it was about 8:30PM so we headed back to the hotel to get some rest for an event filled Saturday.

## Tokyo - Day 2

Saturday we had breakfast at the hotel and then headed out to [Meiji Jingu](https://www.meijijingu.or.jp/en/). This was about a 20 min walk from our hotel and was a really beautiful Shinto shrine with epic walking paths to the main shrine. We were lucky enough to see other tour groups and so we were able to eavesdrop on what the tour guide was saying and learn about some of the history of the shrine. We walked to the main shrine and were lucky enough to see a wedding that was taking place there, this was really cool to see and something we just were fortunate with the timing. We also bought these wooden plates and wrote our wishes for the year on them and added them to the wish shrine they had in the main area. On the way out we saw a seperate part of the area that had a [garden](https://www.meijijingu.or.jp/en/whattosee/garden/). We were a little early for the Azalea boom but nonetheless it was an awesome experience and one I would recommend checking out if you end up making your way to the shrine. There is a pond as well that is beautiful and we saw some turtles which was a delight to see and a well that was created years ago that still flows to this day. Afer this we decided to head over to [RizLabo](#gluten-free-pancakes---tokyo) and get some delicious gluten free pancakes. After the most delicous pancakes we have ever had we headed over to do some shopping and went to [Jordan World of Flight](https://www.nike.com/retail/s/shibuya-x-jordan). I bought myself some Jordans and some shirts some of which I had been looking to buy for years. If you are a sneakerhead definetly recommend checking out Jordan World of Flight. We did some more shopping in the general area and then headed back to the hotel. After this we prepared for dinner at [Ostuna Sushi](#gluten-free-sushi---tokyo). After dinner we decided we wanted to see what a Japanese nightclub was like and decided to go over to [Camelot](https://clubcamelot.jp/enjoy/). We generally try and checkout the nighlife when we go to a new place to see what it is like and this did not disappoint. This is a story club with choice of EDM on 1 floor, hip/hop on another, and k-pop on another. Change your scene at a whim. The vibe was good and we had a blast.

## Tokyo - Day 3

After a night out drinking and dancing we got a later start than usual but still got up in time for breakfast at the hotel and then headed over to [Sensoji Temple](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3001.html). When we got there it wasnt to crowded so that was great and we were able to move around and take pictures with ease. After this we headed to [Ginza](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3005.html) and were able to walk around without cars on the roads because of the [golden week holiday](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2282.html). We went to [Itoya](https://www.ito-ya.co.jp/lang/en/index.html) a 9 level stationary store that had all sorts of knick knacks and we grabbed some for gifts for our friends and families back home.

# Gluten Free

## Gluten Free Curry - Tokyo

[CURRY HOUSE CoCo ICHIBANYA](https://www.ichibanya.co.jp/english/) We arrived in Tokyo at about 6PM. After our 13 hour flight we settled in and had our goals set on getting some food and then maybe a drink and going to bed by 9PM. We decied to try because they were going to be quick without much wait and we wanted to try the gluten free curry. They have an allergen free curry that is issentially the curry base with vegtables on top of rice and the curry comes in its own seperated packet so you can be sure that its safe to eat. This was a great dish that only needed extra spice but it was a great option for quick hot meal.

## Gluten Free Pancakes - Tokyo

[Riz Labo](https://www.rizlabo.com/) This place was amazing! We got some gluten free pancakes here but they also do gluten free crepes. Their menu changes based on the day and ingredients that are in season. We got some strawberry matcha pancakes that were the fluffiest pancakes we have ever had! The matcha was a delicous combination and the strawberries tasted so fresh and sweet. I suggest going to the website and looking at the menu. The location was a little inconspicous to find however after some google images and maps we were able to find it. They opened at 12 and there was already a line so I suggest getting their a little bit earlier to avoid waiting to long.

## Gluten Free Ramen - Tokyo

[Gluten Free T's](https://glutenfree.co.jp/home-en/). We went here for some gluten free ramen that was in a dedicated gluten free kitchen. I think we can all relate to feeling at ease in a place that is dedicated gluten free. We can keep those dreaded antibodies down in a place like this. The menu had Cajun Friend Chicken and Gyoza so we made sure to pick up those in addition to the the ramen and chicken. We also decided to wash it all down with a cocktail and some beers. It was a delightful experience and I recommend adding some spice to your meal with their in house hot sauce. The server we had spoke fluent english so communication for us was quite easy. This was overall a very relaxing and delicious experience and with little anxiety for us celiacs with an all gluten free kitchen.

## Gluten Free Sushi - Tokyo

[Otsuna Sushi](https://otsuna-sushi.com/) This sushi place was delicious! We messaged them on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/otsunasushi1875/) to reserve seating and prepicked our menus. They have a specific gluten free menu you can order from. We ordered the OMAKASE special. The sushi was so fresh and delicious. The assortment of tastes was wonderful and I especially enjoyed the tuna belly. We also ordered a bottle of wine and some sake to go with this meal and really enjoyed the presentation, the abmience and overall atmoshphere of this place. Highly recommend reaching out and getting a reservation and menu picked and check this place out.

## Gluten Free Okonomiyaki - Osaka

[Oko Osaka](https://www.oko-osaka.com/english-menu) This place has some character!! WOW! I really enjoyed this spot, there owner is also the cook, the server, the bartender(sorta), and the cashier. I would recommend getting here early and prepare your self for a good time. From the writing covered walls, to the chicken you squeeze when you pay for drinks, this place was truly unique and the food is hearty and delicious. Okonomiyaki is a japanese pancake made from wheat flour batter and other ingredients cooked on a teppan. Common additions include cabbage, meat, and seafood, and toppings include okonomiyaki sauce, aonori, katsuobushi, Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger. This place however uses soybean flour so its gluten free for a lot of options. There are some meats that are marinated in gluten containing sauces but you can easily avoid them and get a delicous meal. There are also vegan and vegetarian options. 

## Gluten Free Soba - Osaka 
[https://genjisoba.co.jp/menu](Genji Soba) This was a cool little spot right in Namba city. We were determined to try some gluten free soba noodles in Japan since we often make them at home. Soba noodles can very easily be made without gluten as they are made primarily out of buckwheat at 80% buckwheat and 20% wheat. Be sure to look at their menu for the gluten free options and they will accomadate. They will even boil the noodles in specific gluten free pot if its not busy so I recommend going early if you are sensitive or celiac. You can also point at the items you want on the menu as they are marked gluten free and that worked for us.

## Gluten Free Beef Plate - Osaka
[Matsusaka M Umeda Fukushima Branch](https://www.matsusaka-projects.com/english/) We have never had the quality of beef like the cuts that were served here. It was incredible! We reached out before hand and they let us know that they did have some gluten free options where the meat was not marinated. We had to reach out through whatsapp which may be fine for others but not something we use often. The staff was super accomadating and helped pick out what our options were. We had never been to a Japanese BBQ place before and were suprised to see the grill in the middle of the table where you cook the cuts of meat they give by yourself. This was an awesome change of pace and we really enjoyed this aspect of the restaurant. It was not difficult to cook the meat as it cooked quickly and was so tender and delicious. If you are a meat eater please please please go checkout this place for yourself.

## Gluten Free Pastry - Osaka 
[comeconoco](https://comeconoco.com/en/cafe/) This little cafe was a two for one! We also scheduled a cooking class with the owner which we did so by messaging on instagram. In the cooking class we made sushi, chicken karage, sesame salad, and seaweed seasoned potatoes. We learned so much about how to make these dishes that we were able to replicate it once we got back home and also learned some interesting tricks to cooking such as how to judge the temperature of cooking oil with chopsticks! Huge fan of the cooking class and we decided to go check out the cafe on another day. We ordered the lunch and some cheesecake, the lunch consisted of a ham and cheese sandwhich, tomatoe bisque, and two scones. The cheesecake was a traditional new york cheesecake. Everything here is made from rice flour and the owners family owns a farm that produces the rice they utilize. Highly recommend reaching out and taking a cooking class and checking out this wonderful cafe.

## Gluten Free Lunch - Kyoto

## Gluten Free Sushi - Kyoto
[Kikyo Sushi](https://kikyo-sushi-kyoto.com/) This sushi place was delicious! The staff was also excellent and accomdating. One of the sons of this family owned restaurant spoke english and was very helpful in letting us know what was gluten free and what was not. With this help we were able to order to our hearts content. With this we were able to order a platter that had an assortment of different sushi. The staff also pointed out to us what rolls were gluten free and what we could order from that as well so we topped off with some sake and rolls as well. Highly recommend checking this place out when you visit kyoto.
